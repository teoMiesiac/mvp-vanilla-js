- Model represents domain specific data. It's ignorant of the UI (Views, Controllers). When Model changes it notifies it's observers.
- View represents current state of a Model and takes care of presentation. Observer pattern was used to let the View know whenever the Model was updated or modified.
- Controller role is to handle user interaction (key press, clicks) and making decisions for the View.
